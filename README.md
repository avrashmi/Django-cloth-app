**Django Clothing Store App (Practice Project)**

This is a practice project I created about 4 years ago while learning Python Django.
The project simulates a basic clothing store application and focuses mainly on building Django models to represent different parts of an online store.

**Project Description**

The app includes models for:

Clothing → stores clothing items with details like size, color, and category

Inventory → tracks stock levels for clothing items

Media → manages product images and related media files

Orders → stores customer orders and their associated products

Products → general product catalog (clothing and other items)

This project was built to practice Django ORM, relationships, and database migrations. It helped me understand how to:

1. Structure models for an e-commerce-like application

2. Define relationships between products, orders, and inventory

3. Use Django Admin to manage store data

4. Work with media files for product images
